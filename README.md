UPDATE/DISCLAIMER:
This is my submission for CMPT 213 Fall 2021 Victor Cheung, Ph.D. You are NOT permitted to copy this code to use it as your own or get "inspration" from it. I am making this repo public for personal reasons, but that DOES NOT mean it's up for grab, matter of fact I don't even own this code, technically this is CMPT 213's property.
